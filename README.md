# Access
Access is the authentication system used across [my website](https://cvaldez.dev/). It's my "one account, all apps" 
solution for everything I make. This solution is what I call the "Access Protocol".

# How can I use it?
... you can't. Yet!<br>
I'm currently updating Access, so it's currently unavailable. Look below to see what the upcoming version will include.

# Update Preview
Access 1.1 will include:
- [Passkey support](https://www.passkeys.com/)
- Overview of all the apps you use
- Delete account feature
- Requesting a Developer Token
- A neat promotional page in the root page
